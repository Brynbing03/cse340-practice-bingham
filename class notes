REQUEST RESPONSE LIFECYCLE:
Client ----> Request{} - key:value, cont. (pass data around) (JSON objects)
                    ->
                        these are middleware functions
                        f() [a]
                        f() need to add some ccss/js
                        f() check role, are you an admin
                        f() if everything works, then it will build the HTML and then send it back to client

you have the browser which is the client and then everything else is backend

All semster we are only going to be using GET and POST(it is for processing data, aka forms) and REDIRECTS(example:logins)

We are going to be building a MPA and multi page application

SPA: bunch of flower pots and the server detects that someone wants the data so they start filling the pots (called hydration)
manna map is an example of a SPA-a single page application (because react)
- this will only call for something if it is missing somthing
- github is a SPA


API's return either JSON files or like a #statuscode
