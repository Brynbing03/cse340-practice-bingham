require = old
ESM import = new

Arrow Functions 
type = "module"

Promises
New Promise(...) = old
resolve()
reject()

New promise(...) = new
async
await (is a stop sign)

      async - function ~~~ (){...}
Const ~~~~ = () => {...}
             async

Nested css
    it is the new css that makes it so web browsers can interperate css a little better 
    the css is written just like the html structure

In this class we use packages and libraies interchangeably. 

Framework is a structure to follow

REQUEST RESPONSE LIFECYCLE:
Client ----> Request{} - key:value, cont. (pass data around) (JSON objects)
                    ->
                        these are middleware functions
                        f() [a]
                        f() need to add some ccss/js
                        f() check role, are you an admin
                        f() if everything works, then it will build the HTML and then send it back to client

you have the browser which is the client and then everything else is backend

All semster we are only going to be using GET and POST(it is for processing data, aka forms) and REDIRECTS(example:logins)

We are going to be building a MPA and multi page application

SPA: bunch of flower pots and the server detects that someone wants the data so they start filling the pots (called hydration)
manna map is an example of a SPA-a single page application (because react)
- this will only call for something if it is missing somthing
- github is a SPA


API's return either JSON files or like a #statuscode

THE REQUEST RESPONSE CYCLE
        Request

Client           CAPP    0) .env (set up stuff) 1) finds out what the user wants: what file, what route... 2) loads the file (.html)

          Res

Request comes in, figures out what files you need, pulls the html. 

Intro to routing - adding other routes 

Templating engines: it allows you to take a html doc and it allows you to block out portions of the page

WS (web soccet) 
  (phone call, talk back and forth)
  Server    (==========)      Client 
                 ws (bi-directional)
                
      - there needs to be a little bit of JS on both sides(server and client side), on the server side, you can also have XML, Py ...ect.

Our assignment
JS into browser that makes it able to talk through to the ws (hang up signal only)

restore.js

Parent Service
